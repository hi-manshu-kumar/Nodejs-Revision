#install node

2> install nodejs from nodejs.org/en

#what node is? 
took js v8 engine in os
js is only in browser
  where we can do route changes 
                do some functions on button click

with nodejs we can write node applications using js syntax that can manipualate file system , creating and removing file ,query database directly , create web servers using node.

runs on v8 engine - takes js code and compiles it into much faster machine code
thats why nodejs is good

m/c cant run php or python
its converted in m/c language which nodejs does faster

nodejs is devloped on c/c++

#cmd
node(creates a console screen)

#difference between browser and m/c  

1>file manipualation and window manipulation in browser
2>window is global object in browser
  in node global is same as window
3> document stores the reference of dom
   process is same as document in m/c {process.exit(0);}

What is node?
node is a js runtime that uses v8 engine - it is an open source js engine written in c/c++ that takes js and compiles to m/c code .its used inside noedjs and browser

why should i use nodejs
netflix ,uber , etc

another db that is hot in market

Node uses an event-driven non blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient .
Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. 

I/O it is somehting that your app does like read and write into db, communication between something .It takes time

non-blocking I/O  - it saves time if 1 user is requesting api fetching others can use database ,file read acess .
let us do more than 2 or more  operation  

<img 1 showing blocking and non-blocking i/o.>

nodejs is single-threaded and uses digest loop.
